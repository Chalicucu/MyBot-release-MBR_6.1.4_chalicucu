1. Switch accounts up to 8!
    To set up total accounts on emulator, go to tab Bot\Profiles and set at "Total CoC Accounts"

2. Dynamic choose group of accounts to play one time:
   - By GUI setup, go to tab Bot\Profiles and set "Accounts Playing List"
         Example: set order as "123"
           mean bot will play on three accounst: 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and switching step is: 1->2->3->1 ..... Change the value to your case.
   - For RUNNING TIME setup, use pushbullet message: BOT ACC ..., BOT ADD <account no>, or BOT REM <account no>
     eg: BOT ACC 138 => bot play with switching step is: 1->3->8->1 .....
         BOT ACC 1386 => add account 6 to order list => bot play with switching step is: 1->3->8->6->1 .....
         BOT ACC 3 => play only on account 3
         BOT ADD 6 => add account number 6 to playing list
         BOT REM 6 => remove account number 6 from playing list

3. Dynamic setup profiles correspond to accounts (& switch profile):
   - By GUI setup, go to tab Bot\Profiles and set "Mapping profile Indexs", choose profiles' index correspond to all accounts registered on your emulator:
     Example, set as: 12311111
     Digit N is the profile index correspond to account N. I have 8 accounts so set up with 8 digits
     For example, you have 2 accounts and the 1st one using profile 1, the 2nd one using profile 3, just set up: profile = 13
   - For RUNNING TIME setup, use pushbullet commands: BOT PRO ..., BOT ALLPRO ...  and BOT MAP ...
    BOT PRO use for set up profiles correspond to playing accounts in ordered step. Example, you have 3 accounts set up by BOT ACC 138, so with command: BOT PRO 124, account 1 will use profile 1, account 3 use profile 2, and account 8 use profile 4
    BOT ALLPRO use for set up profiles correspond to all exists accounts. Example, BOT ALLPRO 12323245 will set up profile for all 8 accounts with digit N is profile index of account N
    BOT MAP will set up profile for only one account: BOT MAP 2-5 => account 2 use profile 5
    (Tips: in my experience, I always setup 1 account as train/donate only with full army setting to >=80%. If the donation account require 100% as full army, it will take longer time to stay at this acc.
      To setup profile as train/donate only, go to tab "Village\Misc" and check "Halt attack" box, then set "when..." option is "Now (Train/Donate Only)" )

4. Provide Multi Switching Mode
  * Mode 0: shortest training. (smart idea and init code by @demen , modified by me)
    The Bot will play first round of play list as ordered,  then identify which account is attacking account and which one is donating account.
    From the 2nd round, Bot play attacking account first. It choose which account has the shortest training time to switch to and attack when reaching full army
    After playing around with attacking accounts by that method, Bot switch to donating accounts, donate then again comeback to attacking accounts.
    And so on...

    * Mode 1: Ordered playing list.
    Bot play accounts sequentially as ordered in play list. This is the original method  provided from previous version

     * Mode 2: Random.
     It mean that the switching is randomized. Any account in play list can be next switching account.
    
   How to setup this option:
   - On Swtich CoC Account GUI, choose mode on "Switching Mode" option.
   - By pushbullet command: BOT MODE <mode ID> 
     Example: BOT MODE 0 => mode set as Shortest training mode

5. Get current order by pushbullet msg: BOT GETORDER

6. Option to enable/disable attack plan.
   If this option is disabled, the attack plan of profile have no meaning, bot will always go to attack after full army
   - On GUI, config on tab Bot\Profiles => set check box "Check attack plan"
   - Pushbullet command: BOT ATKP 1 => enable attack plan,
                             and: BOT ATKP 0 => disable attack plan

7. Option to tell the bot go to relax, if one account in order list is not in attack plan. Set "Relax attack together" on GUI
Note that all the BOT command will be applied on next switching step.
